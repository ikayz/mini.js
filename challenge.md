#Challenges mini.js
### challenge 1 ###
Challenge is on branching.

Using an "if" statement, create a test that checks if the value in a variable is between 24 and 42, 50 and 100
it should display or print out to the console the following.
1. "You have entered a value between 24 and 42"
2. "You have entered a value between 50 and 100"

Else it should display;

3. "You have entered a value I don't recognise"
4. "You have gone too far"

NB: Look at challenge.js, code has been started finish to get the response. Added missing code in index.html to run file successfully.
